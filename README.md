# thunk
Thunk is an LLM-powered tool that transforms Git repository histories into human-readable narratives of software evolution. It uses retrieval-augmented generation and long-context summarization to explain not just what changed in a codebase, but why it changed, helping developers understand design decisions and architectural progress over time.
